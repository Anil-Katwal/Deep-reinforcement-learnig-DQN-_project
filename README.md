# DQN Implementation for CartPole

This repository contains an implementation of the **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** algorithm to solve the **CartPole** problem using reinforcement learning. The objective is to train an agent to balance a pole on a cart by applying forces to the cart. The agent learns to take actions based on states observed from the environment to maximize its cumulative reward.

### Key Points in the README:

- **Algorithm**: Describes the overall approach of DQN, combining Q-learning with deep learning techniques.
- **DQN Steps**: A breakdown of the specific steps followed in the implementation, including how the Q-network and target network interact and update.
- **Usage**: Explains how to train and test the DQN agent.
- **Requirements**: Lists the dependencies needed for the project.
- **Training**: Detailed explanation of how the agent is trained, including hyperparameters and Q-learning update steps.

This file provides complete documentation for your DQN implementation, helping users understand the process of using, training, and testing the agent. Let me know if you'd like to add anything else!
